Repository version (see the web page for the last modification date)
(will become) Version 1.1.0 (unreleased)

* stxxl is now hosted on sourceforge: http://stxxl.sourceforge.net/
* Restructured the source layout:
  - includes moves to include/
  - introduced some public headers:
    stxxl.h, stxxl/algorithm, stxxl/bits, stxxl/deque, stxxl/io, stxxl/ksort, stxxl/mallocstats, stxxl/map, stxxl/mng, stxxl/priority_queue, stxxl/queue, stxxl/random, stxxl/scan, stxxl/sort, stxxl/stable_ksort, stxxl/stack, stxxl/stream, stxxl/timer, stxxl/vector
  - the header "stxxl" is no longer available, please use "stxxl.h" instead
  - the use of any other (internal) header is discouraged, additional public headers can be added as the need arises
* Overhauled the build system:
  - merged configuration files, simplified option tuning
  - support object files and binaries with and without mcstl support existing in parallel
  - the library build creates stxxl.mk which can be included in an applications makefile to set the correct compiler/linker switches for stxxl
  - similarly mcstxxl.mk is created for a stxxl compiled with mcstl support
  - add dependency tracking and improve parallelism during build
* compiler support matrix:
  compiler      |  stxxl    stxxl + mcstl
  --------------+------------------------
  GCC 4.3       |    x            x
  GCC 4.2       |    x            x
  GCC 4.1       |    x           n/a
  GCC 4.0       |    x           n/a
  GCC 3.4       |    x           n/a
  GCC 3.3       |    o           n/a
  GCC 2.95      |    -           n/a
  ICPC 9.1.051  |    x            x¹ 
  ICPC 10.0.025 |    x            x¹
  MSVC 2005 8.0 |    x           n/a
    x = full support   o = partial support   - = unsupported
    n/a = compiler does not support OpenMP which is needed by MCSTL
	¹ = does not work with STL GCC 4.2.0 (ICPC bug), workaround: 
	    the first include in the program must be
	    "stxxl/bits/common/intel_compatibility.h"
* obsolete files removed
* fixed include dependencies
* fixed lots of warnings
* fixed lots of small bugs
* add header compilation tests
* stxxl::vector: implemented some more functions
* const char* stxxl::get_version_string(): new function
* comparators inherit from std::binary_function<>
* cleanup, reformat the code to a consistent format (Thanks, uncrustify!)


------------------------------------------
Version 1.0e (4 June 2007)

* Bugfix: for objects with the destructors, memory block were allocated in a non-aligned fashion
* Internal CPU efficiency of Stxxl priority queue is improved (loser trees in external mergers are integrated)
* Fixed bug with conversion of const/non-const iterators, implemented comparison and difference operations on const/non-const iterators (for vector, map, and deque) 
* Added operator[] to vector and deque iterators
* stxxl::random_shuffle added
* improved makefile structure (thanx to Andreas Beckmann)
* Allow parallel build for g++
