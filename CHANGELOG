Version 1.2.0 (UNRELEASED)

* made the block management layer thread-safe
* made all size_types unsigned
* stxxl::priority_queue
  - fixed a rare assertion
  - fixed a race condition by using proper block hinting
  - insert_queue: replaced std::priority_queue with a special
    implementation internal_priority_queue that allows for
    fast exporting of all elements
  - even more bugs and inefficiencies fixed
  - significant speed improvements
* random number generators are now all seedable,
  should allow redoing identical program runs for debugging purposes
* stxxl::noncopyable, inspired by boost::noncopyable: inheriting from this
  class forbids copying of objects when this is undesirable
* stxxl::vector, all sorting functions: replaced TwoToOneDimArrayRowAdaptor
  with ArrayOfSequencesIterator which is much faster, especially
  if blocks have padding
* if required, verify that the sentinels satisfy a strict weak ordering
* fix existing alloation strategies and add experimental support for
  distinguishing between regular disks and flash devices
* add compatibility wrappers for standard extensions
  hash_map, hash_set, auto_ptr
* MCSTL is only supported with g++ 4.2 and icpc 10.x
* lots of small bugfixes
* general code cleanup
  - fixed most compiler warnings
  - elimination of duplicate and unused code
  - cleaned up and sanitized debugging macros
  - no more 'using namespace std' and 'using namespace stxxl'
  - fixed ambiguities noted by g++ 4.3
  - add/unify/cleanup copyright headers
* general code reformatting (uncrustify)
* add support for new compiler releases
* portability fixes for different platforms
* build system
  - lots of small modifications
  - now only requires GNU make 3.78 or later
  - check whether STXXL_ROOT has been set correctly and if unset, try
    autoconfiguration by creating make.settings.local with defaults
  - improved and simplified boost support for posix systems
* update install and usage instructions
* spell checked sources and documentation

------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.0 (31 July 2007)

* stxxl is now hosted on SourceForge: http://stxxl.sourceforge.net/
* Restructured the source layout:
  - includes moves to include/
  - introduced some public headers:
    stxxl.h, stxxl/algorithm, stxxl/bits, stxxl/deque, stxxl/io, stxxl/ksort, stxxl/mallocstats, stxxl/map, stxxl/mng, stxxl/priority_queue, stxxl/queue, stxxl/random, stxxl/scan, stxxl/sort, stxxl/stable_ksort, stxxl/stack, stxxl/stream, stxxl/timer, stxxl/vector
  - the header "stxxl" is no longer available, please use "stxxl.h" instead
  - the use of any other (internal) header is discouraged, additional public headers can be added as the need arises
* Overhauled the build system:
  - merged configuration files, simplified option tuning
  - support object files and binaries with and without mcstl support existing in parallel
  - the library build creates stxxl.mk which can be included in an applications Makefile to set the correct compiler/linker switches for stxxl
  - similarly mcstxxl.mk is created for a stxxl compiled with mcstl support
  - add dependency tracking and improve parallelism during build
* compiler support matrix: (for an up-to-date list, please see the doxygen documentation)

    n/a = compiler does not support OpenMP which is needed by MCSTL
	¹ = does not work with STL GCC 4.2.0 (ICPC bug), workaround: 
	    the first include in the program must be
	    "stxxl/bits/common/intel_compatibility.h"
* pipelined stream::sort, stream::runs_creator and stream::runs_merger are parallelized using MCSTL
* obsolete files removed
* fixed include dependencies
* fixed lots of warnings
* fixed lots of small bugs
* add header compilation tests
* stxxl::vector: implemented some more functions
* const char* stxxl::get_version_string(): new function
* comparators inherit from std::binary_function<>
* cleanup, reformat the code to a consistent format (Thanks, uncrustify!)

------------------------------------------
Version 1.0e (4 June 2007)

* Bugfix: for objects with the destructors, memory block were allocated in a non-aligned fashion
* Internal CPU efficiency of Stxxl priority queue is improved (loser trees in external mergers are integrated)
* Fixed bug with conversion of const/non-const iterators, implemented comparison and difference operations on const/non-const iterators (for vector, map, and deque)
