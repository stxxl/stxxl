* parallel_pipeling (is currently being developed in it's own branch)

* There is currently no support for Boost libraries (not headers) in a user
  specified location.

* replace build system, something with '$LIBNAME-config --libs --cflags ...' would be nice

* if the stxxl disk files have been enlarged because more external memory
  was requested by the program, resize them afterwards to
  max(size_at_program_start, configured_size)
  https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4925158

* new types: stxxl::size_type_internal stxxl::size_type_external

* integrate unordered_map branch
  => Milestone: 1.3

* doxygen: do not link every occurrence of 'file' to stxxl::file

* allocation strategies: provide a method get_num_disks()
  and don't use stxxl::config::get_instance()->disks_number() inappropriately

* interleaved_allocators: provide a constructor that takes a base strategy
  as parameter, not a disk range, and derive desired information from the
  strategy

* implement recursion in stable_ksort and do not assume random key
  distribution, do sampling instead
  as a start, at least abort early if the expected size of a bucket is larger
  than the memory available to sort it

* debug stable_ksort in depth, there are still some crashing cases left

* put some stxxl/defines.h (config.h/...) header somewhere,
  listing/describing all the #defines that may be used somewhere

* stxxl::debugmon: FIXME! is not working any more

* continue using the new approach for STXXL_VERBOSE:
  $(CXX) -DSTXXL_VERBOSE_FOO=STXXL_VERBOSEx
